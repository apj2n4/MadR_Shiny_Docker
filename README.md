# MadR_Shiny_Docker
The attached R markdown describes the procedure to clean a kaggle dataset for loan defaults from Lending Club. https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data. A logistic regression model was then fitted to the data. A simple Shiny App was created out of this machine learning model for predicting loan default rate. (https://arunpjanakiraman.shinyapps.io/loan_default_app/)
A docker image was created for the app and then deployed onto a Digital Ocean server. This was basically done to illustrate an alterante way to deploy the app for usage.
